This Python-based WhatsApp chatbot automates responses on WhatsApp Web by simulating user interactions through pyautogui and processing message context with the Groq API. Itâ€™s designed to recognize specific users and provide responses in both Hindi and English, making it suitable for automating customer support, FAQ responses, or managing personal chats on WhatsApp Web.


Features

Code Overview
main.py - Runs the bot, captures cursor positions, and interacts with the chat interface.
